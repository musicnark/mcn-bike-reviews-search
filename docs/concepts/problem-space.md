# Motorcycle News
MCN is a weekly print magazine and website owned by Bauer Media. They generate revenue by monetising attention and trust with this content. The Bike Reviews section is one of the biggest content avenues when measured by page views, making any workflow improvements to this area potentially highly lucrative.

# Tech Stack
MCN's website at the time was based on WordPress, and the team uploading content to it had some technical literacy. They had been promised a new CMS by the company, that had been in the works for over twelve months, and rollout was being delayed time and time again. Nobody on the editorial team had access to the source code for the website, including me, just the content on it. They used Monday.com to organise workflows.
